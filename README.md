# testingReactAppIssues

resolved my issue of the blank white screen when deploying any react app

if anyone ever has that same issue make sure to check each of these areas when following the steps to deploying a react app:

check your homepage that you paste into the json instead of just copying the url from your github and paste into the homepage line for example

ex:        https://github.com/gundamtrooperx/testingreactappissues

make it like this

ex:        https://gundamtrooperx.github.io/testingreactappissues/

you want to take out the public url which is the github.com portion

thats for doing the homepage part but if you had errors and felt lost when doing all the steps to deploying your react app before finding this 

and had already ran "npm run deploy" 

then next i want you to type in npm run build to let rerun the app to the right route for it to all work again
